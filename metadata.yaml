description: Wilkie Collins's intriguing story about a blind girl, Lucilla Finch,
  and the identical twins who both fall in love with her, has the exciting complications
  of his better-known novels, but it also overturns conventional expectations. Using
  a background of myth and fairy-tale to expand the boundaries of nineteenth-century
  realist fiction, Collins not only takes a blind person as his central character
  but also explores the idea of blindness and its implications. His sensitive presentation
  of the difficulties, disappointments, and occasional delights which follow the recovery
  of sight by someone blind since infancy is still one of the best accounts in fiction
  of a problem which continues to intrigue philosophers, psychologists, and the general
  public, as it has done since it was first discussed by Locke and Berkeley in the
  eighteenth century.
